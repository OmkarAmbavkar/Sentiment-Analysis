# Sentiment-Analysis

📝 Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes over 3,000 verified product reviews from a public dataset to determine customer sentiment. The goal was to classify reviews as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, and to uncover recurring themes that influence customer satisfaction.

🧠 Key Objectives
Transform raw textual data into structured insights

Build and evaluate multiple classification models for sentiment prediction

Visualize sentiment trends and keyword patterns across reviews

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

NLP Tools: NLTK, TF-IDF Vectorizer

Models: Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression

🔍 Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Cleaned and normalized review text

Applied tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming

Converted text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization

2. Feature Engineering
Mapped numerical ratings to sentiment labels (positive/negative)

Created feature sets for model training and testing

3. Model Training & Evaluation
Trained three classification models:

Random Forest

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Achieved:

Accuracy: Up to 81%

F1-score: 87.5%

Evaluated using:

Confusion matrix

Precision and recall

4. Visualization
Word Clouds: Highlighted frequent positive and negative terms

Keyword Frequency Plots: Identified common customer concerns

Bar Charts: Compared sentiment distribution across rating levels

✅ Outcomes
Built reliable sentiment classification models with strong generalization

Extracted actionable insights from customer feedback

Strengthened understanding of NLP workflows and model evaluation

Gained hands-on experience in transforming unstructured data into business intelligence

📈 Future Enhancements
Integrate deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for improved accuracy

Deploy as a web app for real-time sentiment analysis

Expand dataset to include multilingual reviews and broader product categories
